## Projects

### [**Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success**](https://github.com/nalapalu/Python_Projects/tree/main/Predicting-SpaceX-Falcon-9-Launch-Success)

#### Objectives:
- This capstone project applies the skills developed during the [IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/professional-cert/URXA2M62VAPC) to a real-world problem: predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches.
- Utilize historical launch data from diverse sources to create a machine learning model that estimates the probability of success for future launches.

#### Data Overview:
- The dataset contains mission information for SpaceX rocket launches and was compiled using:
  - The SpaceX API
  - Web scraping from Wikipedia with BeautifulSoup.

#### Methodology:
- Demonstrated data extraction via an API and web scraping techniques.
- Focused on cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis.
- Conducted EDA to understand the dataset and explore relationships between features and the target variable. Visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- Developed machine learning models for prediction using Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and NumPy.

#### Key Findings & Insights: 
- Achieved 87.7% accuracy with a logistic regression model.
- KSC (Kennedy Space Center) launch site had the highest success rates, likely due to stable environmental conditions.
- Success rates improved over time as providers refined their procedures.
- Payloads exceeding 6,000 kg were less successful, possibly due to increased difficulty and susceptibility to weather conditions.

## [**Statistical Assessment: Automobile Price Analysis Study**](https://github.com/nalapalu/Python_Projects/tree/main/Statistical%20Assessment%20Automobile%20Price%20Analysis%20Study)  

### Objectives:
This project showcases my expertise in statistical analysis and machine learning using Python to examine sales trends for an automobile retailer. The primary goals include:  
- Identifying the key factors influencing car prices.  
- Forecasting future sales trends through time series analysis.  
- Assessing the statistical significance of differences between feature categories.  

### Data Overview:
The dataset consists of fictional automobile sales data, including:  
- Time series data on vehicle sales.  
- Specifications and features of various car types.  
- Monthly records of advertising expenditures, pricing, and units sold.  

### Methodology:  
- Developed relevant business questions to extract meaningful insights from the data.  
- Performed data loading, cleaning, and imputation of missing values, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
- Applied statistical tests (Chi-Square, ANOVA, Ordinary Least Squares) to identify features most relevant to determining car prices.  
- Constructed a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict car prices based on different attributes.  
- Conducted time series analysis using Exponential Smoothing and Seasonal ARIMA to forecast sales for the upcoming quarter.  

### Key Findings & Insights: 
1. **Price Determinants:** Strong correlations exist between vehicle horsepower, engine size, and price (correlation coefficients > 0.8). OLS regression analysis confirms that engine size significantly impacts pricing (**p-value < 0.05**).  
2. **Category Comparisons:** Significant price differences were observed across vehicle body types (**p-value < 0.05**), whereas fuel type variations showed no statistically significant price effects (**p-value > 0.05**).  
3. **Predictive Performance:** The Multiple Linear Regression model demonstrated robust predictive accuracy, achieving an RÂ² value of approximately **0.83** on the test dataset.  
4. **Influential Features:** Among all numerical attributes, engine size, horsepower, curb weight, and car width emerged as the strongest predictors of price due to their high correlations.  
5. **Sales Forecast:** Using time series models, Q1 2025 sales were forecasted, projecting **577 units**.

### [**Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction Project**](https://github.com/nalapalu/Python_Projects/tree/main/Kaggle_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Project)

#### Objectives:
- This project predicts Titanic passenger survival using features like age, gender, ticket class, and more. The workflow includes:
  - Data loading and exploration.
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing.
  - Feature engineering.
  - Model training and evaluation.
  - Hyperparameter tuning and generating predictions.

#### Data Overview:
- The dataset was sourced from the Kaggle competition, [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).
- It contains training and test datasets with passenger details such as name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.
- The test dataset omits the survival column, which serves as the prediction target.

#### Methodology:
- Conducted data exploration, cleaning, and preprocessing.
- Implemented feature engineering techniques.
- Trained and evaluated machine learning models.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.
- Generated predictions based on the trained model.

#### Key Findings & Insights: 
- The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy, at 77.9%.
- Grid search cross-validation enhanced the performance of the SVM model.
