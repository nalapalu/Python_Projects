## Overview

This repository contains Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks and related files for portfolio projects I’ve completed. The projects span across different industries and use cases, showcasing:
- Use of Data Science libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, SciKit-Learn 
- Data Visualization Techniques
- Data Collection, Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning and Deep learning techniques

## Projects

Here is a list of the projects included in this repository:

1. [**Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success**](https://github.com/nalapalu/Python_Projects/tree/main/Predicting-SpaceX-Falcon-9-Launch-Success)
 
   **Objectives**:
   
   - This capstone project aims to apply the skills acquired during the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program to a real-world problem: predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches.
   - Utilize historical launch data from various sources, develop a machine learning model to estimate the probability of success for future launches.

   **Data**
   
    The dataset contains mission information for rocket launches conducted by SpaceX (Space Exploration Technologies Corp)., and was compiled using:
   - The SpaceX API
   - Wikipedia Page using webscraping with BeautifulSoup
  
   **Methods**
   
   - Demonstrated data extraction via an API and showcases web scraping techniques.
   - Focused on cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis.
   - Performed EDA to understand the dataset and explore relationships between features and the target variable. Visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn.
   - Focused on machine learning predictions using Sklearn, pandas and numpy

   **Results and Insights**
   
    - The Logistic model achieved an 87.7% accuracy rate.
    - KSC launch site had the highest success rates, likely due to stable environmental conditions.  
    - Launch success rates improved over time as providers refined their procedures.
    - Payloads over 6000kg were less successful, possibly due to increased difficulty and susceptibility to weather.

1. [**Kaggle Titanic Survival Prediction Projects**](https://github.com/nalapalu/Python_Projects/tree/main/Kaggle_Titanic_Survival_Prediction_Project)
 
   **Objectives**:
   - The Titanic survival prediction model uses passenger information such as age, sex, ticket class, and other features to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster. The project follows a standard machine learning workflow:
    - Data loading and exploration
    - Data cleaning and preprocessing
    - Feature engineering
    - Model training and evaluation
    - Hyperparameter tuning
    - Prediction generation

   **Data**
   - The dataset was taken from a Kaggle competition, [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
   - It contains and training and test dataset which include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc.
   - The test dataaset does not contain the Survive column, and the goal is to predict it. 

   **Methods**
   - Data loading and exploration
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing
   - Feature engineering
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Hyperparameter tuning
   - Prediction generation

   **Results and Insights**
    - The SVM achieved the Highest score an 77.9% accuracy rate.
    - KSC launch site had the highest success rates, likely due to stable environmental conditions.  
    - Launch success rates improved over time as providers refined their procedures.
    - Payloads over 6000kg were less successful, possibly due to increased difficulty and susceptibility to weather.
