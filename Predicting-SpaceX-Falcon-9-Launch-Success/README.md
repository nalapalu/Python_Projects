# Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 Launch Success

Welcome to the repository for my capstone project under the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate. This Readme provides an overview of the project's goals, structure, and installation instructions.

## Project Overview

This capstone project aims to apply the skills acquired during the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program to a real-world problem: predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches. Utilizing historical launch data from various sources, I developed a machine learning model to estimate the probability of success for future launches.

### Sources of Data
The dataset was compiled using:
- The SpaceX API
- NASA's website
- A Kaggle dataset on SpaceX launches

Python was used for data extraction and cleaning with Pandas. Below are the key components:

#### Data Extraction
- [**DataCollection.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/DataCollection.ipynb): Demonstrates data extraction via an API.
- [**WebScraping.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/WebScraping.ipynb): Showcases web scraping techniques.

#### Data Wrangling
- [**Data_Wrangling.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/Data_Wrangling.ipynb): Focuses on cleaning, handling missing values, and transforming data for analysis.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed to understand the dataset and explore relationships between features and the target variable. Visualizations were created using matplotlib and seaborn.
- [**EDA.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/EDA.ipynb): Performed Exploratory data analysis with pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, matplotlib
- [**EDA_sql.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/EDA_SQL.ipynb): EDA using SQL queries.

#### Interactive Analytics
- [**Visualization.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/Visualization.ipynb): Geospatial visualizations using Folium and  Interactive visual analytics with Plotly.

### Machine Learning Model

A machine learning model was developed to predict launch success. Various algorithms were tested, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The best-performing model was a Logistic model with an accuracy of 94.4%. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used for evaluation.
- [**Machine_Learning_Prediction.ipynb**](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/Machine_Learning_Prediction.ipynb): Focuses on machine learning predictions using Sklearn, pandas and numpy

### Key Findings

[Slide Deck with results](https://github.com/nalapalu/IBM_Data_Science_Capstone/blob/main/Final_assignment.pdf)
#### Decision Tree Model Insights
- The model achieved an 87.7% accuracy rate.
- KSC launch site had the highest success rates, likely due to stable environmental conditions.
- Launch success rates improved over time as providers refined their procedures.
- Payloads over 6000kg were less successful, possibly due to increased difficulty and susceptibility to weather.
